Speller.c => A program that's designed to spell-check a file loading dictionary of words from disk
dictionary.c => dictionary

In dictionary.c:
node represents a node in a hash table
table[N] is a pointers to table of nodes in hash table. N = 26 here for number of alphabets.

bool check(const char *word) returns true or false
	-based on whether the word (char * or string) is in dictionary or not. ( To be implemented)

unsigned int hash(const char *word); 
bool load(const char *dictionary); const means you can't change those within the function

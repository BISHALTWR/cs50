Database:
- A database is a way of organizing data such that you can perform four operations on it
    -- create
    -- read
    -- update
    -- delete
- A database management system(DBMS) is a way to interact with a database using a graphical interface or textual language.
- Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft Access, MongoDB etc
- The choice of a DBMS would rest on factors like:
    -- cost: proprietary vs. free software
    -- Amount of support: free and open source software like: MYSQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite come with the downside of having to set up the database yourself.
    -- Weight: more fully-featured systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL are heavier and require more computation to run than systems like SQLite.

SQL:
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to interact with databases, via which you can create, read, update, and delete data in a database.
    -- It is Structured.
    -- It has some keywords that can be used to interact with the database.
    -- It is a query language - It can be used to ask questions of data inside a database.
- SQL is a standard both of the American National Standards Institure(ANSI) and the International Organization for Standarization (ISO).
    -- Most DBMS support some subset of the SQL language.

SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name>; //Or you can use * for all columns

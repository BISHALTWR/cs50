# SQL tutorial

## Write SQL query to solve the following questions using the schema given below:
> STUDENT (CRN, FNAME, LNAME, DOB, AGE, DISTRICT, WARD_NO, VDC/MUNICIPALITY, PROGRAM, BATCH, PHONE)

> ACCOUNT(CRN, ACCOUNT_ID, FEE, PAID_MONEY)

- Table creation
```sql
CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
    CRN VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    FNAME VARCHAR(50),
    LNAME VARCHAR(50),
    DOB DATE,
    AGE INT,
    DISTRICT VARCHAR(50),
    WARD_NO INT,
    VDC_MUNICIPALITY VARCHAR(50),
    PROGRAM VARCHAR(50),
    BATCH INT,
    PHONE VARCHAR(10)
);

CREATE TABLE ACCOUNT (
    CRN VARCHAR(50),
    ACCOUNT_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FEE FLOAT,
    PAID_MONEY FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CRN) REFERENCES STUDENT(CRN) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
- Inserting data
```sql

## Past Questions:

Consider the following relational database model:
Hotel (Hotel_No, Name, Address)
Room (Room_No, Hotel_No, Type, Price)
Booking (Hotel_No, Guest_No, Date_From, Date_To, Room_No)
Guest (Guest_No, Name, Address)

Write SQL statement for the following.

a. List all the guests who have booked rooms at the Everest Hotel.
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Guest
WHERE Guest_No IN (
    SELECT Guest_No FROM Booking
    JOIN Hotel ON Booking.Hotel_No = Hotel.Hotel_No
    WHERE Hotel.Name = 'Everest Hotel'
)
```
b. Create a view to expose only the hotel_No, Guest_No, Room_No, and price of all booked rooms.
```sql
CREATE VIEW view1 AS
SELECT Booking.Hotel_No, Booking.Guest_No, Booking.Room_No, Room.Price FROM Booking
JOIN Room ON Booking.Room_No = Room.Room_No AND Booking.Hotel_No = Room.Hotel_No;
```
c. Find the total cost of the deluxe rooms at Everest hotel after offering a 5% discount.

```

d. Identify the hotel name which has the highest total guests.

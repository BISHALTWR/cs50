# Learning Git and GitHub

## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. This guide will walk you through the basics of both.

## Part 1: Git Basics

### Step 1: Installation

First, you need to install Git. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the instructions provided on the page for your specific operating system.

### Step 2: Configuration

After installation, you need to configure your Git. This is important as every Git commit uses this information. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
### Step 3: Basic Commands

Here are some basic Git commands you should know:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository. This is typically run in the root of your project directory.
- `git clone <url>`: Clones a repository from `<url>`. This is how you can get a copy of an existing repository.
- `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area. This is the first step in recording your changes. Replace `<file>` with your actual file name.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commits the changes with a message. The message should be a brief summary of the changes you have made.
- `git push`: Pushes the changes to the remote repository. This updates the repository with your latest commits.
- `git pull`: Fetches the latest changes from the remote repository. This is how you get updates from others who are also working on the project.

For more details on these commands and more, check out the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) online.

## Part 2: GitHub Basics

### Step 1: Creating a GitHub Account

First, you need to create a GitHub account. You can do it [here](https://github.com/join). Fill in your details and follow the instructions.

### Step 2: Creating a Repository

1. Click on the '+' icon on the top right corner of the GitHub homepage.
2. Click on 'New repository'.
3. Name your repository, add a description (optional), and click 'Create repository'.

### Step 3: Cloning a Repository

1. Click on the 'Code' button in your repository.
2. Copy the URL.
3. Run `git clone <url>` in your terminal.

For more details on using GitHub, check out the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github).

## Part 3: Exercises

To solidify your understanding, try these exercises:

1. Install Git and configure your user name and email.
2. Create a new repository on GitHub.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Create a new file in the repository, add some text to it, and save it.
5. Use `git add` to stage the file, `git commit` to commit it with a message, and `git push` to push the changes to GitHub.
6. Go to your GitHub repository and confirm that the changes are there.

## Conclusion

This guide should give you a good start on using Git and GitHub. Remember, practice is key when learning new tools. Good luck!

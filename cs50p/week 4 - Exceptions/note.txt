Exceptions => Problems in your code

SyntaxError : Error you made when typing the code (like missing closing bracket)
ValueError: You are doing stuff with not supported data type (using methods for integers on string)
EOFError: When user presses Ctrl+D to end the input
LogicalError: Error in logic of algorithm/program

Error Handling in python:
    # try:
        indented block of code
    # except ValueError: # To handle ValueError
        indented block of code
    # else:
        This indented block of code will run if there is no error

Debugging:
    # print
    # rubber duck debugger. (talk to someone, even if it's non-living)
    # Vs code has a debugger.
        # breakpoints allow you to execute your code stopping at the position of breakpoints
        # you get control bar with play, step over(run but don't go inside), step into, ...
        # Also you get variables with their value in side panel when they are created and their value is changing

Comparision operators: >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=

if statement for conditional statement:
    # if(condition):
        # Block of code indented here
    # You can use 'or', 'and', 'not' operators to combine conditions
    # Use fewer conditional statements if possible
    # it is possible to use : (90<= score <= 100) which is not possible in C or C++

You can create a function that returns boolean value:
    # You need to use True/False as return value (Title Case)

match-case statement:
    # Equivalent to switch case statement in other languages
    # You don't need break statement for each case
    # for default case use case _:
    # match name:
        case value1:
            block of code indented
        case value2|value3|value4: # You can combine multiple cases like this
            block of code

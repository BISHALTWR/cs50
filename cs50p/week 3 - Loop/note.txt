python has while loop:
    while (condition):
        # indented block of code here
        # don't forget to update to avoid infinite loop
        # while True: can be useful if you wan't user to do something necessarily

python consists data type list:
    # [1,2,3] is a list
    # You can use list_name[index] to display item in index position (First is 0 index)
    # you can use len(list_name) function which returns length of list
    # .sort() method sorts and returns None. It modifies the original list
    # sorted() function sorts and returns a new list

python has for loop:
    # for loop iterates through a list
        e.g. for i in [0, 1, 2]:
                # indented block of code here
                # value of i will be 0, then 1, then 2 and loop will stop
    # You can use function range(value) which is equivalent to providing list from 0 to value
        e.g. for i in range(5):
    # You can do print("meow\n" * 3, end="")

python also has dictionary:
    # students = {
        "key":"value"
        "key":"value"                        
    }
    # You can access value using key like students[key] will return the value
    # For loop iterates over keys only in dictionary
    # You can create list of dictionary
    # list(dictionary_name) returns a list of all the keys in dictionary
    # There is no predefined function to sort a dictionary
        # Extract list of keys, sort it and use it to change list.
    # .pop(key) pops the key:value pair and returns the value

File Input Output allows you to store data in file so you can use it later
    # open lets you open file
        # file1 = open("file_name.ext", "mode")
            # mode can be:
                w for write(which recreates it, overwriting old one)
                a for append(which doesn't remove old data)
                r for read mode
    # file1.write(value) to write data to file
    # file1.close() to close the file
    # with closes the file for you:
        with open("filename.ext","mode") as file1:
            indented block of code,
            file is closed after execution of this block of code
    # lines = file1.readlines() lets you get all lines of file1 as list
    # Using strip() is helpful most of the time
    # OR, you could use for line in file:

CSV (Comma Separated Values are great for storing multiple pieces of information)
    # Eg:
        Bishal, 23
        Biraj, 17
        Appu, 22
    # This has one column of names and one column of age

    # lambda function can be used for one time use function(i.e. only at one place in code)
        # lambda student: student["name"]

There is a module called csv:
    # it has .DictReader() that reads as dictionary and .reader() that reads as list
    # .DictWriter(file) and .writer()
    # next(csv_reader_object) returns next row in csv file (Super useful for heading)

There is tabulate library to tabulate csv file

Web socket establishes two way connection between client and server.
    -Alternative to polling (frequently asking server for data)

Handshake:
    Client sends http request to the server to open a connection
    If the server agrees, it will send a 101 switching protocols response
    handshake complete.
    TCP/IP connection is left open, allowing bidirectional message to pass between them with low latency.

Full-duplex connection
